## About me
I am extremely interested in Front-end. It gives you the opportunity to create amazing things for people. Front-end is like a playground where you can realize your creative impulses.

I have studied intensively with HTML Academy: completed HTML and CSS course level 1, HTML and CSS course level 2 and JavaScript level 1 during which I learned adaptive html-coding according BEM methodology, less/sass, JavaScript basics, Gulp and Git. I am also a little familiar with Bootstrap and jQuery. Moreover, I am very much ready to learn new things and technologies that might be needed for productive work.

Studying with **R S School** seems to be very attractive to me as it could give me an opportunity to improve my skills significantly.
